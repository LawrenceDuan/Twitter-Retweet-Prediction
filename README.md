# Twitter-Retweet-Prediction

This project objectives are: first proving is that realistic to have an algorithm or a model to predict the behaviour of retweeting, then discovering how to build such algorithms or models to perform prediction and how well could they performed, and finally explore which factors or features contribute the most to the behaviour of retweeting. Besides, this project tries to propose a method to distinguish “tweets that the users do not want to retweet” and “tweets that the users do not able to browse”.
